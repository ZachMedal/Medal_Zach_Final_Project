# Medal_Zach_Final_Project
This project was going to be a recreation of Fall Down but I had some problems so I made some late changes not to many to the code. It is a recreation of Flappy bird where you try and get through as many platforms as possible before hitting one

# Description

# Getting Started


# Dependenciea
Need actual coding, Visual Studio Code, Python 3.11 64 bit installed, and windows 

# Instalation
Install pygame and either copy and paste code to VSC or download the file to open and run it

# Executing program
When "run" is clicked in VSC which makes the code boot up and playble on the windows screen

# Help
The collision detection between the player and platform could use a little tweacking as well as the player image so the black border does not show up
